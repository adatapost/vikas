Scope
======

A system - "Mobile Automotive Technician" is composed of two main components: a client-side application which will run on Android handsets, and a server-side application which will support and interact with various client-side features. 
The system is designed to facilitate the process of searching, tracking and settling shared vehicles, automotive mechanics and shops detailed data. Potential scenarios include searching locations, emergency contacts, managing requests/orders/complaints, paying charges, and encouraging people etc.

The main component of the project is the software application, which will be limited to the Android operating system (specifically Android 2.2 and above). The application is not resource- or graphics-intensive, so there are no practical hardware constraints. The app will rely on several functionalities built into Android’s Application Programming Interface (API), so ensuring appropriate usage of the API will be a major concern. 

Beyond that, the application is a self-contained unit and will not rely on any other Android-related software components. The application will, however, frequently interact with the JavaEE Application server, a virtual dedicated server. The server operates on a Linux/Windows platform with 2 GB of RAM and 100GB of allocated storage space. The database will be stored on the server using MySQL and will be interfaced with a wrapper written in JavaEE RESTFul application.
